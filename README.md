# Hi, I'm Oscar

## About Me 
I'm a senior CS student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I am currently very interested in software development and artificial intelligence, but I am always eager to investigate new topics that may catch my eye.

I've worked on various projects both personal and academic, such as having developed a WebApp with a videogame included to train Ternium personnel, develop a Discord Bot that responds to messages and can play music from YouTube and play it on the voice chat and I'm currently working on the development of an enterprise management application using Open AI's API to optimize certain process of management and help with the creation of profiles.

I have also interned at Ternium, Aimbridge Latam and Wizeline.
